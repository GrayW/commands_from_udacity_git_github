Lesson 1

diff -u <file1> <file2> : compares to files.
mkdir <dir_name> : create a directory
git log: to get the list of commits
git diff <commit id1> <commit id2> : compare to commits. Useful if you want to find a specific bug or change.
git log --stat : gives statistics about which files have changes in each commit.
git clone <URL> : clone an existing repository
git clone <URL> <name of the directory> : the same as the previous command except that you can specify the name of the directory. 
git checkout <commit id> : to temporarily reverse history to this particular commit. Useful if there is a bug, but we are not sure in which commit it was introduced.
